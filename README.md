- 👋 Hi, I’m Elikem Asudo Gale-Zoyiku, a junior at Ashesi University, Ghana, majoring in computer science (although I have a bit of an engineering background).
- 👀 I’m interested in any project that is geared toward eliminating access barriers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IoT, and embedded machine learning (struggling at it though 😂).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project at all. I love adventures.
